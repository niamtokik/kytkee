Disassembler in Erlang

## INRIA PoC

Writed this code during an INRIA event, when talking
about disassembler. I have writed this peace of code
to disassemble x86 file.

Note: its not functional, and only disassemble raw
strings without parsing ELF or anything else (no 
entry point). This is total bullshit, but I wanted
to see if writing disassembler will be neat.
